# Transact_Mvc project
## Details:
This is my small mvc project(ASP.NET CORE MVC on .NET8) where the user can register, login and perform various operations from it:
He can deposit money in the bank deposit, as well as withdraw money.
After logging in, the user's active balance and deposit can be seen in the personal account.
I added an Identity(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore). For password hashing I used nuget package weetinviAPI.
I use Ajax for the requestes.
He can also make money transfers to the account of other Users, according to their E-mail.
I have added validations to these operations, which I have written in the controllers.
I used a standard ORM: EntityFrameWorkCore. I performed migrations so that the written models were automatically generated in the database.
I styled the views as much as possible.
Enjoy it.
